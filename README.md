NCE_study_guide
===============


Study guide that parses a txt file containing headers "question", "choices", "answer", "explanation" and tracks right or wrong answers while providing explanations for wrong answers

Intended as a study guide to the National Counselors Exam

Unfortunately, I cannot add the questions file as the questions are the property of a different author.
